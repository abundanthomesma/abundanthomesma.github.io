## Our Mission

Abundant housing for all is an urgent moral imperative throughout Massachusetts.

## The Problem

Massachusetts has a severe housing shortage. We aren’t building enough homes to keep pace with demand, especially near jobs and transit. What’s more, 50 years after the passage of the federal Fair Housing Act, much of what we have is still largely segregated by income and race.

## Our Goals

We want to create, sustain, and enhance:

* Abundant housing for all
* A housing market that lets people move when they want, where they want, not when they have to
* Communities with ethnically and economically diverse residents
* Development patterns that facilitate low-carbon lifestyles

## Our Solution

We are advocates for:

* More housing near transit and jobs
* Robust tenant protections to prevent displacement
* Reform of exclusionary zoning rules
* Sustainable development practices and communities
* Robust funding of social and subsidized housing

We believe that when communities, builders, and planners come together, in good faith, to find positive solutions, we can address our housing crisis while minimizing negative impacts to our community.

## Our Actions

We will:

* Convene pro-housing groups around the state shape their messages and become more effective
* Nurture diversity within grassroots pro-housing groups
* Coordinate support for statewide and local legislative and regulatory initiatives

## Stay Tuned!

We’re working hard to launch early this year.
